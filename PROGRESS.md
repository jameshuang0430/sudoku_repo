# Progress Log

## 2026-04-16 Transformer Upgrade

### Current Progress
- Completed deterministic solver, dataset export, fixed `train/val/test` manifests, training, evaluation, and PNG plotting workflows.
- Verified baseline MLP training and test evaluation end to end.
- Started implementing a Transformer baseline that will live alongside the existing MLP.

### Issues Encountered
- `functions.apply_patch` failed on Windows with `windows sandbox: setup refresh failed with status exit code: 1`.
- A parallel read checked `PROGRESS.md` before the file write completed.

### Resolution
- Switched to bounded PowerShell file writes inside the repo as a fallback, while keeping changes limited to the intended files.
- Switched progress-log updates back to serial commands when read-after-write ordering matters.

### Next Steps
- Add `SudokuTransformer` and a model factory.
- Update checkpoint loading and training CLI to support `--model transformer`.
- Add tests and rerun the suite.
